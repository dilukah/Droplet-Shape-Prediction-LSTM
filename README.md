Figure 1 a) Experimental data of a hexadecane droplet at the air-ferrofluid interface for the initial state and two sequential
actuations of the solenoids b) Shape representation with 32 segments along the contour of the shape c) LSTM-based
model for shape prediction. The scale bars are 2 mm. [1]

Figure 2. Validation results for shape prediction of a hexadecane droplet at the air-ferrofluid interface for five sequences.
The blue and red dashed lines show the actual and predicted contours, respectively. Actuated solenoids are marked with
green indicators and deactivated solenoids are marked with red indicators. The scale bars are 2 mm. [1]
